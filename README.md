# Java-Alarm-Clock
A simple Alarm Clock built in Java

## How it works
This Alarm Clock takes the input of the user as the time where an alarm should ring. Once a valid time is set, the AlarmClock class starts a new thread and displays the current time until the alarm. Once the time is up, music starts playing.

## Disclaimer
The music used is part of the free YouTube library. I do not own the music but it is free to use.
